# This is a basic GitHub Actions workflow file.
# It demonstrates how to create a file and upload it as a build artifact.

# Name of the workflow, which will be displayed in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository.
name: Upload Build Artifact

# Controls when the workflow will run.
# This example triggers the workflow on push events to the main branch.
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel.
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on.
    # 'ubuntu-latest' is a good general-purpose choice.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Create a directory to store the artifact
      - name: Create artifact directory
        run: mkdir -p my_artifact_folder

      # Step 3: Create a sample file to be uploaded as an artifact.
      # In a real-world scenario, this step would be your build process
      # which generates files (e.g., binaries, compiled code, test reports).
      - name: Create a sample file
        run: echo "Hello, world! This is a sample artifact." > my_artifact_folder/sample-file.txt

      # Step 4: Use the official 'upload-artifact' action to archive and upload the artifact.
      # This action takes the files you specify and uploads them to the workflow run.
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          # The name of the artifact to be uploaded. This will be visible in the GitHub UI.
          name: my-artifact
          # The path to the file or directory to upload.
          # You can use wildcards. In this case, it's the directory we created.
          path: my_artifact_folder/
